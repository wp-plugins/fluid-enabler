Fluid Enabler is ready for any language. *French* localization is done, *English* should be okay, but *Spanish* may be approximative. If you ever find any translation error, or if you want to help submitting a new language, please contact me.

**Note :** Installation process changed a little. When updating **from 0.2 to 0.3**, you may need to re-activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress to get it work again. You'll also have to **delete the old 'fluidenabler' folder**. (Sorry, I apologize for that, I'm new SVN and WordPress, so I'm learning).

Installing Fuild Enabler is very easy and do not require any template modification. Just follow these steps :

1. Upload the folder `/fluid-enabler/` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

It's that simple !

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't see anything. Is the plugin working ? =

This plugin only works on Mac OS X because it uses third party Macintosh software. You need to use a *Site Specific browser* built with [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) app to see notifications and dock badge.

If you're running a Fluid browser on Mac OS X, everything should be fine.

= What is the number displayed on the dock icon ? =

The number you can see on the dock icon (in the *badge*) is the number of comments your moderation. It looks like Mail's Dock icon. Useful to see quickly if there are new comments.
